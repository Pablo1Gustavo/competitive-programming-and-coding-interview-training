# Compeititve programming and coding interview training

*Total of problems solved at the moment:* **50**

## Objective

>This is a public repository of my study in algorithms and data structure for programming competitions like OBI and Maratona SBC de Programação and coding interviews.


## How to view the problem of the code

>Each of the folders represents a website of programming problems. It are:

* Neps Academy, represented by folder "neps_academy". To view the problem access `https://neps.academy/exercise/code` changing "code" for the code in the file name.
* Google Code Jam, represented by folder "google_codejam". To view the problem access `https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/contest_code/problem_code` changing "contest_code" and "problem_code" for the both codes, respectively, in the file name separeted by an underline.
* Beecrowd (old URI), represented by folder "beecrowd". To view the problem access `https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/code` changing "code" for the code in the file name.
* CSES Problem Set, represented by folder "cses". To view the problem access `https://cses.fi/problemset/task/code` changing "code" for the code in the file name.
